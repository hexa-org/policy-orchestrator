# Development

**NOTE:**

The development tasks herein are also made available via (optional) bash "CLI"
utilities within the repository. Once the initial bootstrapping setup has been
run (via `./bin/pkg.d/setup.sh`), these tasks and more may be executed via the
`dev` and `pkg` CLIs.

For example, try running the following from anywhere within the repository
(assuming the prerequisite "setup" has been run).

```bash
$ dev version
$ dev --help

$ pkg version
$ pkg --help
```

## Task: Bootstrap

> This task may optionally be completed (see **NOTE** above) via:
>
> 1. `pkg setup`
> 2. `dev setup --target=opa`

Clone or download this codebase from GitHub to your local machine and install
the following prerequisites:

* [Go 1.20](https://go.dev)
* [Pack](https://buildpacks.io)
* [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
* [Open Policy Agent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org) (OPA)
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
* [golang-migrate](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate)

## Task: Set up a "test" DB

> This task may optionally be completed (see **NOTE** above) via:
>
> - `dev setup --target=db`

### Create a test database in PostgreSQL:

```bash
createuser orchestrator
createdb orchestrator_development --owner orchestrator
psql --command="alter user orchestrator with password 'orchestrator'"
psql --command="grant all privileges on database orchestrator_test to orchestrator"
```

### Run the DB migrations:

```bash
migrate -verbose -path ./databases/orchestrator -database "postgres://orchestrator:orchestrator@localhost:5432/orchestrator_test?sslmode=disable" up
```

## Task: Run the test suite

> This task may optionally be completed (see **NOTE** above) via:
>
> - `dev test`
> - `dev test --clean`

Before making your contributions, ensure the test suite passes:

```bash
go clean -testcache
go test  ./.../
```

Use the following command to clean up your test cache when needed.

```bash
go clean -testcache
```

## Task: Run the Hexa Applications

> This task may optionally be completed (see **NOTE** above) via:
>
> - `dev serve`

### Steps

- Load the environment variables defined in the `.env_development` file:

  ```bash
  source .env_development
  ```

- Run the Hexa Policy Admin web application.

  ```bash
  go run cmd/admin/admin.go
  ```

- Run the Hexa Policy Orchestrator server.

  ```bash
  go run cmd/orchestrator/orchestrator.go
  ```

- Run the demo web application locally.

  ```bash
  go run cmd/demo/demo.go
  ```

- Run the demo config application locally.

  ```bash
  go run cmd/democonfig/democonfig.go
  ```

- Run the open policy agent server locally.

  ```bash
  opa run --server --addr :8887 -c deployments/opa-server/config/config.yaml
  ```
## Task: Orchestrator endpoints via Postman
Hexa Orchestrator uses [Hawk Authentication](https://github.com/mozilla/hawk/blob/main/API.md) to allow clients to make authenticated requests.

During Authentication, the client sends a MAC (Message Authentication Code) as part of the Hawk Authorization Header.

The MAC is calculated using HMAC with SHA256 hashing over the `normalized request string`.

The `normalized reqest string` is made up of the HOST, PORT amongst other things.

If you run the Hexa Policy Orchestrator using `docker-compose up` and try to hit an orchestrator endpoint via Postman `localhost:8885`, you will get a `401 Unauthorized`
- This is because Postman calculates the MAC using `localhost:8885`.
- HOST and PORT that Orchestrator users to verify the MAC is specified by the `ORCHESTRATOR_HOSTPORT` environment variable in `docker-compose.yml`

### Steps
To hit the Orchestrator endpoints via Postman:
- Remove the `ORCHESTRATOR_HOSTPORT: hexa-orchestrator:8885` environment variable from the `docker-compose.yml`

NOTE: This will cause problems if you are running the admin app to do things with the orchestrator. 
The admin app uses the orchestrator host and port when sending requests so the key would need to be added back at this time.

See [Hawk authorization failing with Postman](https://github.com/hexa-org/policy-orchestrator/issues/261) for details.

## CodeQL

GitHub CodeQL is used in the Hexa CI pipeline for vulnerability scanning.
CodeQL can also be installed and run locally on a developer workstation.

To run locally:

- Install via [Homebrew Formulae](https://formulae.brew.sh)

  ```bash
  brew install codeql
  ```

- Install the CodeQL "packs" for Go analysis. The packs and an installation
  script are located in the [CodeQL repository](https://github.com/github/codeql)
  and must be cloned locally.

  ```bash
  cd $HOME/workspace
  git clone https://github.com/github/codeql
  ./codeql/go/scripts/install-deps.sh
  ```

- Create a local database.

  ```bash
  cd $HOME/workspace/policy-orchestrator/
  CODEQL_EXTRACTOR_GO_BUILD_TRACING=on codeql database create .codeql --language=go
  ```

- Analyze the results.

  ```bash
  codeql database analyze .codeql --off-heap-ram=0 --format=csv --output=codeql-results.csv ../codeql/go/ql/src/codeql-suites/go-security-and-quality.qls
  ```
