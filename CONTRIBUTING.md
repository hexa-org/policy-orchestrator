### Create a new provider

The Hexa project has several providers for integrating with different cloud platforms or systems (Google, Microsoft,
Amazon, etc.). If you would like to extend Hexa and build a new integration - go for it! We will be here to support your
effort along the way. New providers an be added to an existing repo or we can create a separate repo if that makes
sense.
