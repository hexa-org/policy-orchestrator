Hexa Policy Orchestrator enables you to manage all of your policies consistently across software providers
so that you can unify access policy management. The below diagram describes the current provider architecture.

![Hexa Provider Architecture](docs/hexa-provider-architecture.svg "hexa provider architecture")

## Getting Started

The Hexa project contains two applications, and demonstrates use of applications
from [Policy-Opa](https://github.com/hexa-org/policy-opa)

- Policy Orchestrator with policy translations
- Demo Policy Administrator
- Demo web application (Policy-OPA)
- Hexa OPA Server and Bundle Server (Policy-OPA)

To get started with running these, clone or download the codebase from GitHub to your local machine:

```bash
cd $HOME/workspace # or similar
git clone git@github.com:hexa-org/policy-orchestrator.git
```

### Prerequisites

Install the following dependencies.

- [Go 1.22](https://go.dev) - Needed to compile and install
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) - Needed to run docker-compose configuration

### Task: Build the Hexa Orchestrator image

Build the Hexa Orchestrator Docker containers...

```bash
cd demo
sh ./build.sh
```

### Task: Run the Policy Orchestrator

These commands are to be run within the `demo` directory

Start the shared KeyCloak and Postgres Server instance.
> [!Note]
> This is the same file found in [Hexa-OPA](https://github.com/hexa-org/policy-opa) project and only needs to be run
> once for both projects.

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.shared.yml
```

When Keycloak is up and running docker will also create a network called `hexa_network` which enables services in
docker-compose.yml to talk to services in the shared docker-compose.

```bash
docker-compose up
```

## Application Descriptions

Docker runs the following applications:

- **hexa-orchestrator**

  Runs on [localhost:8885](http://localhost:8885/health). The main application service API
  that manages IDQL policy across various platforms and communicates with the
  various platform interfaces, converting IDQL policy to and from the respective
  platform types using the [Hexa Policy-Mapper](https://github.com/hexa-org/policy-mapper) SDK. This service uses TLS
  and is protected and uses JWT authorization tokens
  (see [RFC7519](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519)) for authenticating access.

- **hexa-admin-ui**

  Runs on [localhost:8884](http://localhost:8884/). An example web application user-interface
  demonstrating the latest interactions with the policy orchestrator. Uses `hexa-orchestrator` to retrieve and provision
  policy.
  <p/>
  The Hexa Admin UI service uses the OAuth2 Client Credentials Grant Flow (see [RFC6749 Section 4.4](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-4.4)) to authenticate to a token server (e.g. Keycloak) and obtain tokens for accessing
  the Hexa-Orchestrator API service using JWT tokens.

- **hexa-industry-demo-app**

  Runs on [localhost:8886](http://localhost:8886/). A demo web application used to
  highlight enforcing of both coarse and fine-grained policy. The application
  integrates with platform authentication/authorization proxies,
  [Google IAP](https://cloud.google.com/iap) for example, for coarse-grained
  access and the [Open Policy Agent (OPA)](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/)
  for fine-grained policy access. In the docker-compose configuration, the server uses the Hexa-OPA-Server

- **hexa-opa-agent**

  Runs on [localhost:8887](http://localhost:8887/). HexaOPA is
  an [IDQL extended](https://github.com/hexa-org/policy-opa) Open Policy Agent ([OPA](https://openpolicyagent.org))
  server used as an IDQL Policy Decision service. In this configuration, The `hexa-opa-agent` server retrieves policies
  from
  the `hexa-opaBundle-server` instance which is an OPA provisioning service.

- **hexa-opaBundle-server**

  Runs on [localhost:8889](http://localhost:8889/health). An OPA HTTP Bundle server from which the OPA server can
  download policy bundles configured
  by Hexa-Orchestrator. See [OPA bundles][opa-bundles] for more info.

- **keycloak** and **postgres**

  These two servers are used to provide an OAuth2 demonstration and testing environment for the Hexa
  demonstration environment. [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org) is pre-configured with a demonstration security "
  realm" called
  [Hexa-Orchestrator-Realm](http://localhost:8080/admin/master/console/#/Hexa-Orchestrator-Realm).

    - The Keycloak administrative interface can be accessed (after starting docker-compose.shared.yml) using the
      URL http://localhost:8080. The default administrative account is admin/not4u2no and the credential should be
      changed immediately. After logging in, select the "Hexa-Orchestrator-Realm" using the drop-down box in the
      upper-left corner.

    - This Hexa-Orchestrator-Realm contains role definitions and Client credential enabling Hexa Admin UI service to
      access the Hexa Orchestrator service. By
      default, a bootstrap admin user id and password are configured (see .env_development). It is strongly recommended
      that these be changed.

    - The realm also contains four test user account each with the password "hexahexa". These accounts are for
      demonstration purposes only.
        - Four test accounts: alice@hexaindustries.io, bob@hexaindustries.io, carol@hexaindustries.io, and
          gerry@hexaindustries.io
        - Each account is a member of a different group with different access rights to to the Hexa Industries Demo app

> [!Note]
> Keycloak is used for demonstration purposes and was selected as part of
> the [CNCF community](https://www.cncf.io/projects/keycloak/).
> Hexa-OPA and Hexa-Orchestrator projects can be configured to use other OIDC providers. See the Environment Variables
> section below.

## Configuration

### TLS Support

In the current release, except for the Hexa Admin UI, and Hexa Industries Demo application, all Hexa services now auto
configure with TLS support. In general if HEXA_SERVER_KEY_PATH is not specified for a server, the startup code will do
the following:

1. Locks the directory to avoid conflict with other server instances
2. Look for an existing CA key pair
3. If not found, generates a new key pair
4. Generates a server TLS key pair using the DNS names specified. Note: in docker, it is best to give each server
   instance it's own key file name and DNS name.
5. Releases the directory lock

> [!Note]
> The lock procedure is done to ensure only 1 set of keys is generated so that all servers will share the same
> self-signed key root.

When a second server starts and obtains a lock, it will use the CA key pair generated by the first server to generate
its own server
key pair.

The intent of this procedure to use TLS whenever possible and to make demonstrations and development easy to set up and
configure. For production use, use externally generated keys from appropriate certificate authorities and assign the key
files to paths using the appropriate environment variable.

> [!Tip]
> When installing in a cloud service provider that will be doing TLS termination, set the value of `HEXA_TLS_ENABLED`
> and
> `HEXA_AUTO_SELFSIGN` to false.

### OAuth2 Support

The Hexa Administration Server currently supports unauthenticated access only and should be installed in a protected
location. It
will be upgraded shortly to support Open Identify (OIDC) based authentication.

The Hexa Administration server now makes provisioning calls to Hexa Orchestrator over secured TLS communications using
the OAuth2 Client
Credentials Grant ([RFC6749 Section 4.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749.html#section-4.4)). In the
docker-compose file, a demonstration configuration is set-up using [KeyCloak](https://keycloak.org)
to authenticate client requests and issue tokens for accessing the Hexa Orchestration Service.

> [!Important]
> To facilitate easy setup for demonstration, Keycloak is preconfigured with a realm (Hexa_Orchestrator_Realm), and a
> client credential. The root
> password to Keylcloak and the `hexaclient` client secret should be changed!  See
> Keycloak [documentation](https://www.keycloak.org/guides#server).

## Example Workflow

Fine-grained policy management with OPA.

Using the **hexa-admin-ui** application available via `docker-compose`, upload an
OPA integration configuration file. The file describes the location of the IDQL
policy. An example integration configuration file may be found in
[deployments/opa-server/example](demo/deployments/hexaOpaServer/example).

Once configured, IDQL policy for the **hexa-demo** application can be modified
on the [Applications](http://localhost:8884/applications) page. The
**hexa-admin** communicates the changes to the **hexa-orchestrator**, or
"Policy Management Point (PMP)", which then updates the **hexa-demo-config** bundle
server, making the updated policy available to the OPA server.

OPA, the "Policy Decision Point (PDP)", periodically reads config from the
**hexa-demo-config** bundle server and allows or denies access requests based on
the IDQL policy. Decision enforcement is handled within the **hexa-demo**
application or "Policy Enforcement Point (PEP)".

The Hexa Demo architecture may be visualized as follows (note: POSTGRES is no longer used by Hexa-Orchestrator and now
uses a JSON based configuration file specified by `ORCHESTRATOR_CONFIG_FILE`):
